# MVC-Techblog

## Description

- The purpose of this week's challenge was to create a blog-style application from scratch, including both the front-end and back-end. This application allows the user to sign-up for an account so that they may be able to use the rest of the functionality that I created, such as the ability to create a new project post and add comments to an existing posts. This challenge was the most challenging by far because I had to create models using sequelize for the back-end of the project. I realized that it is important to have a solid back-end foundation before attempting to get too deep with the front end. As for the front-end part of the project, the hardest for me was joining the back-end logic to the front-end in order to create the overall functionality of the project 

## Installation

- There is no additional installation required for the user to use this application, but resources used are as follows:

    Nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en/

    Sequelize : https://sequelize.org/

    Handlebars: https://handlebarsjs.com/

## Usage
- In order to use this application, the user must first sign-up for an account. After sign-up, the user is allowed to create, delete, and update their project posts and as well as have the ability to comment on a post.
